# Procrastinator

This is a hacker news client for Android. There is no license yet,
but it'll most likely be something liberal like Apache 2.0.

This app will be used as a teaching aid in helping folks get up to speed
with Android development. Currently this is a work in progress, so
you YMMV. This app might kick your dog or slap your wife.

You've been warned!!!!
